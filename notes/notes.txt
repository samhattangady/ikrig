Not sure. I think the first goal is to load in all the positions of the
different joints. Rest can be handled later.
Okay, so the whole thing is a nested tree, and I don't think it can be done
without recursion. So yeah, we'll have to figure out the recursion. Or we can
figure out the cube display first. Sure, lets do that one. Because otherwise
we won't know if we're doing correctly or not.

Awesome. The nodes are loading. So we have that all worked out.
Next we need to do the animation.
