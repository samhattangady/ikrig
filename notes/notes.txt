Trying to read the collada file. Odin has an xml reader, but it seems like it
just stores all the elements without a tree. Or maybe the tree is stored
separately... Lets check

Not sure. I think the first goal is to load in all the positions of the
different joints. Rest can be handled later.
Okay, so the whole thing is a nested tree, and I don't think it can be done
without recursion. So yeah, we'll have to figure out the recursion. Or we can
figure out the cube display first. Sure, lets do that one. Because otherwise
we won't know if we're doing correctly or not.

Awesome. The nodes are loading. So we have that all worked out.
Next we need to do the animation.

So I guess we have to start figuring out the animations now. Haha. So it seems
like the whole thing that we did was again replicated in the animations.
Except the animations don't maintain the tree. So we will have to get the tree
from the scene, and then the animations from the anim_lib.

So I guess the way we have stored the nodes doesn't make sense. It should also
encode the tree. And maybe we don't need positions, and we should just be
saving the transforms instead.

NEXT: We have loaded in the raw transform vals. Next we have to multiply them
correctly so that they make sense. So we have to traverse down the tree and
multiply the matrices and store them again.
